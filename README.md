# Module 15 Challenge

## Leaflet Challenge 

In this assignment, we made a cool earthquake map! We used a geojson API to grab earthquake data and placed markers on the map. The size of each marker shows how big the earthquake was, and the color represents its depth. We even added tooltips to give you quick info about each earthquake, like its magnitude, location, and depth.
